        	<p>Isaac Steckly is a first-year multimedia production student at Lethbridge College focused on video editing and graphic design. Isaac didn’t always want to work in Multi Media, before he was interested in digital art and film making, he wanted to work with machines as a robotic engineer so that he could invent his own Iron Man suit and fly around.</p>

		<p>Outside of school, Isaac lives a simple life of peace and tranquility so long as he remembers to take his medicine in the morning and the afternoon. He travels on occasion, most recently to Orlando Florida to go see the Kennedy Space Center, where he got to take a bus tour of NASA itself and even meet Winston Scott, a real astronaut in person. Isaac enjoys playing videogames and building with Lego bricks in his spare time. He enjoys building with his Legos because it is a chance for him to show off his creativity and let it run wild.</p>
